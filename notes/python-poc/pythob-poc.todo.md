## **3. Message Summarization**

### **3.1 Summarization Triggers**

- [ ] Implement the `POST /summarization/start` endpoint to trigger message summarization.
- [ ] Define the frequency and criteria for automatic summarization.
- [ ] Ensure summarization runs efficiently and handles edge cases.

### **3.2 Summarization Status**

- [ ] Create the `GET /summarization/status` endpoint to check summarization progress.

- [ ] Integrate the Local Language Model (LLM) for reply generation.
- [ ] Ensure the reply suggestions are context-aware and meet user preferences.

### **4.2 Reply Approval**

- [ ] Create the `POST /replies/approve` endpoint for approving generated replies.
- [ ] Track the status of replies (e.g., "generated", "approved", "sent").
- [ ] Ensure approved replies are sent to the specified conversation in WhatsApp.

### **4.3 Reply Updates**

- [ ] Implement the `POST /replies/update-reply` endpoint for updating replies with user feedback.
- [ ] Allow users to modify or add content to the generated replies.
- [ ] Re-generate replies based on user addendums if necessary.

## **5. Custom Reply Proxy**

### **5.1 Custom Reply Handling**

- [ ] Implement the `POST /replies/custom` endpoint for proxying custom replies.
- [ ] Ensure custom replies are sent to the specified conversation in WhatsApp.
- [ ] Validate the format and content of custom replies before sending.

### **5.2 Custom Reply Validation**

- [ ] Add validation for custom reply text and metadata.
- [ ] Handle errors for invalid or malformed custom replies.
- [ ] Return appropriate status codes and messages for successful or failed custom replies.

---

## **6. System Health and Status**

### **6.1 Health Monitoring**

- [ ] Implement the `GET /system/status` endpoint to check system health.
- [ ] Include metrics such as uptime, message count, error rate, and resource usage.
- [ ] Ensure the endpoint provides real-time status and performance data.

### **6.2 Performance Metrics**

- [ ] Track and log performance metrics for API endpoints (e.g., response time, throughput).
- [ ] Implement monitoring for database performance and connection health.
- [ ] Alert for critical performance issues or downtime.

## **7. Reminder Management**

### **7.1 Reminder Creation**

- [ ] Implement the `POST /reminders` endpoint to create reminders for specific messages.
- [ ] Allow users to set reminder times and priorities.
- [ ] Ensure reminders are stored and tracked in the database.

### **7.2 Reminder Retrieval**

- [ ] Create the `GET /reminders` endpoint to retrieve all reminders.
- [ ] Filter reminders by message ID, priority, or status.
- [ ] Ensure reminders are returned with relevant metadata.
